# How to perform typical tasks with Scribus

This collection of hints on how to perform typical tasks with Scribus is very similar to a "Frequent Asked Questions" document and has been indeed been compiled by collecting the answers to questions asked by real users in the Scribus community.

But this is not a FAQ, because everybody asks the questions in a different way and it's hard to formulate the questions in a such a way that people can find the answer to their questions.

We have tried to find out what are the specific tasks one wants to achieve and we try to give short answers with pointers to further documentation, where you can learn more about the way you can use Scribus to achieve your task.
